# General information

## Development process

I tried to follow a TDD approach for the most part. This was not always easy,
especially at the beginning, since the general structure of the application
was under constant change.

## External sources

This application was created as a gem. The initial setup, as well as the gem
release was done using bundler. Every other dependency is listed in the gemspec
file.

The implementation of the recursive algorithm is based on information I
found [here](https://www.cs.bu.edu/teaching/alg/maze/).

## Final notes
The initial gem name was Mazer. Unfortunately, the name was already taken by
another gem.
